# About {-}

This page exists to help collate together R resources for the NUMBATs group, to direct students to places to learn more about specific R content. It is not intended as a replacement for courses, but instead a place where people can go to learn more.

The core principles for the resources on this page are:

- Content should be fresh and relevant, rooted in practical example, "why should we care"
- The way these resources are distributed should be:
  - Accessible, reproducible, extendible
- Links shared must work

**Got an idea? Want a resource on a particular area?**

- You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/numbats/resources/issues/new)
- You can contribute by [editing the rmd directly]() or forking and making a pull request
- Ping Nick Tierney on the NUMBATs Slack
