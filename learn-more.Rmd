# Learning more

R is a big world that attracts people from all sorts of different disciplines.

Below is a list of free online resources and textbooks for learning about R, and R's application in other areas.

## Statistics / Data Science / Forecasting

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  - From wrangling data to visualisation, wrangling dates and strings, and writing. Written by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
- [Forecasting Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)
  - Forecasting using R, written by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopolous. From the philosophy of forecasting, to time series graphics, methods on ARIMA, calculating features, and time series decomposition.
- [Modern Dive: Statistical inference vis data science](https://moderndive.com/)
  - Written by Chester Ismay and Albert Kim, covers data wrangling, regression, bootstrapping, and inference, using the [infer package](https://tidymodels.github.io/infer/)
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
  - Free PDF to download. Excellent introduction into concepts on linear regression, classification, cross validation, decision trees, and more.
  
## R Programming

- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
  - Covers deeper details on how R works
- [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)
  - This book tells you how to write an R package, from the mechanics of getting started, _when_ and _why_ to write and R package, and _how_ to do it well. Written by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.
- [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/). 
  - Written by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace, this looks at using R from a purely _efficient_ perspective. So, how to install and update R with the least fuss for the most gain, how to use R so it is fast, how to optimise your code efficiently, as well as topics like parallel computing and how to collaborate with others.

## Other resources for learning more about R

- [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/) by Oscar Baruffa, "the only [R] bookmark you'll need in the future". Contains many similar topics to this resource book, but with a very wide scope.
- [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/) - Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R by Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 TAs. This book came from the STAT 545 book delivered at UBC, it covers topics from installing R to version control, writing, data manipulation, dates, joins, writing functions, visualisation, package writing, automation, web scraping, and using shiny.
